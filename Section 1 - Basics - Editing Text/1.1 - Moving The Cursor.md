One of the core concepts of fast typing is to keep the fingers at the home row.

Vim main navigation uses a variation of the home row to replace the arrow keys.

The following keys replace the use of arrows.

To move the cursor, press the h,j,k,l keys as indicated.

	     ^
	     k		    Hint: The h key is at the left and moves left.
    < h	    l >		   The l key is at the right and moves right.
	     j			   The j key looks like a down arrow.
	     v
  1. Move the cursor around the screen until you are comfortable.

  2. Hold down the down key (j) until it repeats.
     Now you know how to move to the next lesson.


NOTE: In Obsidian the arrow keys also work, but it's better to use hjkl, since this will help you move around much faster (once you get used to it.)
