## What is this?
This is a modification of vimtutor made for obsidian.

## What Is Vimtutor
vimtutor is usually presented as one long file which comes with a new installation of vim.

The purpose of vimtutor is to provide strong foundation for new vim users.

## How to set-up
Download this folder, `git clone` it if you know how, or simply clock on the top right corner where it says "code" > Download to ZIP.

From there you can unzip the folder and open it in obsidian as a vault.

## Why Format This For Obsidian
Obsidian has a way to activate Vim key bindings.

you can turn it on by going to:
`Settings > Editor > Vim Key Bindings`

vimtutor helped me get started with vim in just one week. If it wasn't for vimtutor I would have given up on vim straight away. Vim now allows me not only to format text extremely fast, but it has quickly become a new way to think about shortcuts.

The main reason why I decided to give Obsidian was because it supported vim-mode.

## Better vim in Obsidian
There is a plugin that allows for a much better experience for vim in obsidian.

Third party plugins > Browse > Vimrc support

this plugin allows us to customize vim, I already added the file in this vault, if you know about vimrc you can customize it.

The file is called `.obsidian.vimrc` you wont see it in your file explorer, because it's a hidden file. 

You can research how to show hidden files for your OS, it's as easy as a simple shortcut in your file explorer.

## What Has Changed In This Version

You can always use the original vimtutor if you install real vim, this version will omit aspects of vim that are not available or applicable in Obsidian.

There will also be some tips and particular aspects of using vim in Obsidian.
