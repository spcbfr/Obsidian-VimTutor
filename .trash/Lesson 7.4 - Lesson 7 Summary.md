  This concludes the Vim Tutor.  It was intended to give a brief overview of
  the Vim editor, just enough to allow you to use the editor fairly easily.
  It is far from complete as Vim has many many more commands.  Read the user
  manual next: ":help user-manual".

	Publisher: O'Reilly & Associates Inc.
  It is a good book to get to know almost anything you want to do with Vi.
  The sixth edition also includes information on Vim.
