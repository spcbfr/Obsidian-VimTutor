> OBSIDIAN NOTE: This lesson is really important if you plan to learn real vim, in Obsidian this doesn't apply nor does it work. 
Give it a quick read just so you understand, but there's no need to try it in Obsidian (nothing will happen).

			    Lesson 1.2: EXITING VIM

  !! NOTE: Before executing any of the steps below, read this entire lesson!!

  1. Press the `ESC` key (to make sure you are in Normal mode).

  2. Type:	:q! `ENTER`.
     This exits the editor, DISCARDING any changes you have made.

  3. When you see the shell prompt, type the command that got you into this
     tutor.  That would be:	vimtutor `ENTER`

  4. If you have these steps memorized and are confident, execute steps
     1 through 3 to exit and re-enter the editor.

NOTE:  :q! `ENTER`  discards any changes you made.  In a few lessons you
       will learn how to save the changes to a file.
